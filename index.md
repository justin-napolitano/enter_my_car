# Enter My Car: A Technical Reflection on Routine and Ergonomics

## Motivation

This project serves as a precise documentation of the routine involved in entering a personal vehicle, with an emphasis on the physical and procedural aspects that influence comfort and efficiency. The motivation is to analyze mundane actions that might otherwise be overlooked but can cumulatively affect physical well-being and daily workflow.

## Problem Statement

Routine actions, such as entering a car, are often performed without conscious attention to ergonomics or procedural optimization. For individuals with physical sensitivities or conditions like OCD, these routines can become sources of discomfort or anxiety. This project addresses the need to document and refine such a routine to minimize physical strain and establish consistent procedures.

## Project Overview

The repository contains a single Markdown file, `index.md`, which outlines the current sequence of actions taken when entering the car. It enumerates steps from opening the door to driving off, noting specific behaviors such as placing the wallet on the instrument panel and setting up the GPS.

The document further identifies pain points, such as knee discomfort caused by the angle of entry, and logistical challenges related to the placement of personal items like backpacks, satchels, water bottles, and umbrellas.

## Implementation Details

- The routine is broken down into discrete steps, facilitating analysis and potential optimization.
- Ergonomic considerations are explicitly noted, including the recommendation to enter the car at a 90-degree angle rather than 45 degrees to reduce knee strain.
- The presence of a makeshift seat cover that shifts during entry is documented, indicating an additional factor affecting comfort.
- Personal item management is addressed, highlighting the need for dedicated storage locations within the vehicle to avoid clutter and improve accessibility.

## Practical Implications

Documenting this routine provides a foundation for developing a standardized checklist to enforce consistent behavior and reduce cognitive load. The ergonomic insights can inform behavioral adjustments or physical modifications to the vehicle interior.

## Future Directions

- Formalize the checklist into a usable format, potentially as a mobile or web application.
- Conduct ergonomic assessments to validate and refine entry techniques.
- Explore storage solutions to accommodate personal items efficiently.
- Expand documentation to include other vehicle-related routines for comprehensive workflow optimization.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies a methodical approach to analyzing and improving a routine physical activity. By explicitly documenting each step and associated challenges, it lays the groundwork for iterative improvement grounded in practical observation rather than abstract advice.
