## Why am I writing this

I am trying to approach life from the perspective that every action throughout the day... no matter how mundane... defines in some way my character.  Each little action can either make life easier or more difficult for me. I do not know if its is possible for an action to be completely neutral.. I am thinking through this. 

### Entering my car

How do I currently entery my car? 

1. I open the door (maybe this is another post)
2. I sit down
3. I close the door
4. I lock the doors
5. I turn on the car
6. I place my wallet on the instrument panel
7. I plug in my phone
8. I (usually) set up the gps to my destination
9. I start music from spotify
10. I place my phone into the dock
11. I drive off

### Is there anything I'd like to change? 

When I enter the car I find myself trying to sit down in a way that hurts my  knees. 

I also often carry my backpack. I move just throw that to the passenger seat. I should find a place for it in the trunk

I carry a satchel as well. I do not take that off.  I that is okay.

I carry a water bottle across my shoulders.  This too can stay where it is.  

When it rains I carry my umbrella. I need to find a dedicated spot for that in the backseat of my vehicle.  


#### Enter the car without hurting my knees

My car is low to the ground.. That is okay.. I have plenty of mobility.. but i try to enter the car at an angle.  this is a mistake. In order to move without hurting myself... I need to sit on the chair at a 90 degree angle instead of a 45.  Just turning my back to the seat and turning will be sufficient. 

Now that said, there is a makeshift seat cover on the driver's seat. It moves oddly when I sit on the seat without the 90 degree angle. Just sitting correctly will solve both problems. 

#### Remove my backpack

```Problem```

I would like to put my backpack into the trunk of the car.. Currently there are two limitations.  

1. My trunk is full to the brim
2. Even if the trunk were clear I would have to first open the driver's side door to access the lever that opens the trunk. 

```Solution``` 

I cannot empty my trunk at the moment because I am traveling. I can however order a new key that will allow me to remotely open the trunk. In the future this will solve my problem.

##### Stop-gap solution

I will put my backpack behind the driver's seat. In order to do this, I will have to keep that area clean. I will also have to make sure my umbrella is not in the way and that there is no water remaining in the back seat.


#### Enter with an umbrella

```Problem```

When entering my car with an umbrella I usuall sit down while holding the umbrella between the gap of the roof and the door.  I then shake out the umbrella before closing it. I then either throw the umbrella into the passengers seat or into the back of my car somewhere. The problems are

1. The umbrella can be damaged
2. The umbrell can be lost
3. The umbrell can drip water 

```Solution```

I need a pvc pipe holster that sits behind the passenger seat... or is attached to the driver's door.  Maybe a pipe cut open and affixed to the beam at the base of the door could do the trick.

I will need to account for water.. i think an open container at the base of door with a great amount of surface area exposed to air will be best to dry out the moisture. I might also be able to rig up a drainage system.  I need to think about this further. 

#### Where to put my satchel

```Problem```

I usualy keep my satchel on my body. But when I am driving long distances I should remove it.

```Solution```

I will hang it from the passenger head rest

#### Where to put my water bottle

```Problem```

I wear my bottle across my shoulder in sling holder. I usually leave it on my body while driving.. but over large distances it would be better to move it to the cup holder

```Solution```

I will need to carry a bottle that fits in the holder.  I do not think that I have one. As a workaround I will try to hang this from a head rest. If this is sufficient and will permit me to drink from it while driving than I will stick with it. Otherwise I will need to revisit... or just buy a bottle that fits into the cup holders.
