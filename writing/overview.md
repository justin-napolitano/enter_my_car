I've got a quirky little project on GitHub called [Enter My Car](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/enter_my_car). It's not your typical software project—we're not building features or APIs here. Instead, I'm diving into the day-to-day ritual of entering your car. And yes, I know what you're thinking: why? Let me explain.

## What It Is and Why It Exists

At its core, this repository is a personal archive. It documents my thoughts, observations, and reflections on the seemingly mundane act of getting into a vehicle. It might sound trivial, but I've realized there's a lot of nuance involved. 

The aim? To optimize physical comfort and procedural consistency while minimizing the hassle that comes with this routine. I'm a fan of structured experiences, even when they seem boring. A smoother car entry can set the tone for a good drive or the rest of the day. Trust me.

## Key Design Decisions

When I was putting this together, I made a few key design choices:

- **Markdown Format**: I chose to use Markdown for documentation. It’s simple, easy to read, and widely supported. No complicated setups needed.
  
- **Static Content**: This isn’t a traditional software repository filled with scripts or executable code. It’s just a plain text file to share observations. That minimalism is intentional.

- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: I wanted to create a granular look at the car entry routine, highlighting ergonomic considerations and the physical challenges I face. 

## The Stack: What’s Under the Hood

1. **Markdown**: The entire documentation is in plain Markdown. Why complicate things?
2. **No Executable Code**: This is purely a documentation effort. Just text, observations, and thought exercises.

## Project Structure

The repo is super straightforward. Here’s how it’s laid out:

```
enter_my_car/
└── index.md       # Main documentation file describing the routine and reflections
```

If you want to dive in, clone it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/enter_my_car.git
```
Then, just open `index.md` in any Markdown viewer. It’s that easy.

## Thoughts on Features

I’ve outlined a few key points:

- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: I dissect my car entry routine. What do I do first? Where do I struggle? This breakdown may seem unnecessary, but it has helped me spot inefficiencies.

- **Physical Challenges**: I've taken time to reflect on knee strain and other discomforts that pop up while getting in and out. It’s a real thing.

- **Item Management**: How do I store my everyday items, like my backpack or umbrella, in a way that’s organized and accessible? I've made a few notes.

- **Checklist Creation**: I’d love to put together a standardized checklist to streamline the process and make it more consistent.

## Tradeoffs and Limitations

Now, let’s talk about tradeoffs. I’ll be honest—this project is not without its limitations. Here’s what I’ve seen:

- **No Application or Code**: Because it’s not software, I’m missing out on a larger potential audience that typically looks for solutions or code.

- **Subjective Nature**: The observations are based solely on my experiences, which may not apply universally. This could lead to varying results for others with different vehicles or habits.

## What’s Next: Roadmap for Improvement

Looking ahead, I see several opportunities for growth:

- **Develop a Formal Checklist**: I want to create a specific checklist that anyone can adopt or adapt for their own car entry routines.

- **Ergonomic Improvements**: I’d like to dig deeper into techniques or modifications that could lessen knee strain when getting in and out.

- **Storage Solutions**: Identifying effective ways to manage personal items inside the vehicle is a work in progress.

- **Structured Format**: It might be worth it to convert these reflections into a more structured format or even an app in the long run.

- **Visual Aids**: Adding images or diagrams to illustrate my ergonomic recommendations could provide better guidance.

## Wrap-Up

Ultimately, Enter My Car is a personal journey into a daily habit that most of us take for granted. If you find yourself intrigued by the idea of optimizing even the simplest tasks, I encourage you to check it out.

Feel free to follow along for updates on social media. You can find me on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X where I share insights and progress on this project and more. Thanks for reading!
